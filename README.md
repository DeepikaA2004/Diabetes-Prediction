# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on various health-related features. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is employed for classification, and the model is trained on a dataset containing relevant attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset (diabetes_data.csv) contains the following features:
Pregnancies
Glucose
Blood Pressure
Skin Thickness
Insulin
BMI (Body Mass Index)
Diabetes Pedigree Function
Age
Outcome (0: No diabetes, 1: Diabetes)
## Model Performance
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved the following accuracy rates:
Training Data Accuracy: 78%
Testing Data Accuracy: 77%

## Results and Discussion
The model demonstrates reasonable predictive performance, with accuracy rates of 78% on the training set and 77% on the testing set. Further optimization and tuning may be explored to enhance model performance.
